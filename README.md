# AWS File Upload w/ Progress Bar

## Description
Simple React component to upload a file to an AWS s3 bucket.

### Scripts
Standard React start-up scripts.

### Todos

1. Rename .env.production to .env and fill in the required variables OR if you are going strait to production set up the variables in your environment.
2. import <AWSFileUpload /> to your component, use component in your application.  AWS File Upload takes currently one prop for client name, but you can modify that to whatever.. This just sets a folder name for upload, if empty it will just upload to root of the bucket.

### Future changes

My plan is to make this more customizable, but it fits my needs for now.
